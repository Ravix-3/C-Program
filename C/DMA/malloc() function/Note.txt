t allocates a single block of memory based on user-specified size. 
It returns null if memory is not sufficient.
It's important to keep in mind that malloc() returns a pointer to the beginning of the newly allocated memory block, 
and it's the programmer's responsibility to free this memory when it's no longer needed.
